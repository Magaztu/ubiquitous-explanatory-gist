A little piece of text explaining the context of this account and its predecesor, originally a gist.

I'm typing this just to get thoughts outta my head.

What is this GitHub account for? As for now, make a record of new stuff I'll be makin'.

Why did I create this new GitHub account? Well, I *did* have one dedicated to uploading progess and useful stuff.
Sadly I forgot how to access it, and since I had a quirky username (something like "MFX7"), I really can't remember the username.
Like, there aren't any traces of it anywhere, it's kinda like it poofed out of existence lol.

So anyways, I'll be uploading some stuff here, sometimes small, sometimes a bit bigger, nothing too crazy I think.
Of course I'll reupload my old projects, including their respective creation dates.

Since this will be my main GitHub from now on, I'll private my old old one's stuff and use it instead for mixed -fun- stuff.
Just because I felt like it, I'll try to mirror my stuff to GitLab as well.

If you read all this, congrats!!! you've earned three lime slices 🍋‍🟩🟩🟩.
